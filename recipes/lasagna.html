    <h1>World's Best Lasagna</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
         A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of<em>mall-curd cottage cheese</em> and <em>Parmesan</em>.
         I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li>A dash of sugar</li>
            <li>dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</li>
            <li>lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>cottage cheese, Parmesan, Shredded Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
